# Contributing to DevOpsCommunity
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Proposing new resources
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host books, to track issues as well as accept pull requests.

## Guidelines
Pull requests are the best way to propose new books and propose new feature to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Add One Resource** per pull request.
3. Pull request should include a short description. 
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rohitg00/devreler/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rohitg00/devreler/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and screenshots

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
